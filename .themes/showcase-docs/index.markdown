Showcase is a portfolio and blog framework built on Jekyll, the static blogging engine powering Github Pages. Showcase is designed to make it fast and easy to set up a portfolio website. Create a webpage for each project with a single command. Include a slideshow image gallery on your project webpage by simply adding images to the project's image folder. If you're a coder, designer, and photographer, you'll love how easy it is to create multiple portfolios.

**Note:** Showcase is a **portfolio+blog framework for coders** who are comfortable with shell commands and basics of Git. If that sounds daunting, Showcase may not be for you.

## Getting Started

This section will help you get set up, and explain how to configure Showcase for your site.

**Note:** If you want to migrate a blog that's not built with Jekyll or Octopress, check out [Jekyll's Migration page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/){:target="_blank"} to help you get your current blog set up for Showcase. If you're already using Jekyll or Octopress, you can copy posts and pages directly into Showcase.
