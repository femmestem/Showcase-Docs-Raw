Showcase is a portfolio and blog framework built on Jekyll, the static blogging engine powering Github Pages. Inspired by the blogging framework Octopress, Showcase is designed to make it fast and easy to set up a portfolio website. If you're already using Jekyll or Octopress then there's nothing to relearn, just more features at your fingertips.

**Note:** Showcase is a **portfolio+blog framework for coders** who are comfortable with shell commands and basics of Git. If that sounds daunting, Showcase may not be for you.

## Getting Started

This section will help you get set up, and explain how to configure Showcase for your site.

**Note:** If you want to migrate a blog that's not built with Jekyll or Octopress, check out [Jekyll's Migration page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/){:target="_blank"} to help you get your current blog set up for Showcase. If you're already using Jekyll or Octopress, you can copy posts and pages directly into Showcase.
