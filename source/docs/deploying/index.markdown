## GitHub Pages

Hosting your site with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is free and allows custom domains. To deploy, push your Showcase repository to GitHub. This is a great way to host a personal site, or even a multi-author site where contributions can be handled with pull requests and commit access.

## Heroku

Like GitHub Pages, Heroku is also free, allows custom domains, and uses a git based deployment workflow. Heroku is a bit simpler to use and your Showcase repository remains private.

## Rsync

If you have a web hosting service, then you can deploy with Rsync--which is quite fast--to sync new and changed files through SSH. If you're looking for a reliable web hosting service that supports SSH, check out [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com/), [BlueHost](http://www.bluehost.com/), or [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/). They're all reputable, performant, and offer great customer support, so you'll be happy with whichever service has the lowest priced package that meets your needs.

**I do NOT recommend GoDaddy.**

## Amazon Web Services

If you want brilliantly fast and consistent performance with reliable site uptime, and you're a technically savvy developer who doesn't mind a more involved deployment setup, I recommend creating an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 account. Service is free for the first 12 months after sign-up ([see details](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)), and after that it costs a minimal [pay-as-you-go fee](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) based on your actual usage.
